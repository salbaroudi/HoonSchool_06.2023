## Introduction:

After trying to code CounterSort in hoon, it seems my understanding of cores, recursion, and functional programming code patterns is still insufficent to solve even meager coding challenges - let alone build an entire app.  Imperative programming habits will have to be broken - as trying to code this way in a functional language is a fool's errand.

 In this section, I work through the Urbit Developer Documentation (all the core specific stuff), and attempt some of the coding challenges that have been presented. Some of these challenges look to be less complicated than CounterSort, but more complicated than the HSL 23' Homeworks. So this is the logical next step for me.
