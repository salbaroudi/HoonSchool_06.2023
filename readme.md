## Hoon School: 06.2023 Cohort:

This repo serves to store all of my notes and work for the [Summer 2023 Hoon School Curriculum](https://developers.urbit.org/courses/hsl). File names and folders should be self-explanatory. A Glossary and Ecosystem.md was added, as Hoon has a number of frameworks and terms that are unfamiliar to most novice users (incluidng me).

This readme.md file will store environment set-up instructions, to get examples working, or aide a developer in setting up a project.
